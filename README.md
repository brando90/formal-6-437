# formal-6-437

Formalizing MIT's **6.437 Inference and Information** in Lean4.

## About

This project aims to formalize the mathematical foundations of statistical inference and information theory as taught in MIT's graduate course 6.437. The formalization targets Lean4 and builds upon [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

## Course Topics

- Bayesian and non-Bayesian hypothesis testing
- Decision theory (minimax, Bayes risk)
- Parameter estimation (MMSE, MAP, ML)
- Exponential families and sufficient statistics
- Information geometry
- EM algorithm
- MCMC methods
- Large deviations and typicality
- Model selection
