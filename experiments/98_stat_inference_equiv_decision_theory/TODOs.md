# TODOs
- define DT
- define GDT
- define stat inference
- relate all 3
- relation to proper
- for proper we need gibbs inequ
- D_kl

    - blog intuition vs CE too
    - what exactly does it mean physically, sending info in channels...literally? 
- for gibbs we likely need D_KL >= 0
    - https://gemini.google.com/gem/414f88ab5ef8/1682e11155c597c4 
- so let's do D_KL first when doing the actual proof
- think of what blog to do from this
